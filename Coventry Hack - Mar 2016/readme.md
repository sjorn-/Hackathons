The files for this hackathon are incomplete due to some difficulties pushing to github during the hackathon, and thus falling out of sync.

Essentially we created an interface for showing someone wearing the muse headband scary videos, and the interface would flash red if they were scared. The checking if they were scared was done by first establishing how they were nominally, and then presenting a video which made them jump, and measuring their brain activity at the maximum. This value was then compared to when watching new videos later on.
